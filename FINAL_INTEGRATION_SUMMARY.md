   class Drone {
     final String id;
     final String name;
     final DroneLocation location; // vs currentLocation
     final DroneStatus status;
     // ... consistent field naming
   }
   ```

   ```dart
   // Complete service implementations
   abstract class MapService {
     Future<List<Drone>> getAllDrones();
     Future<List<Mission>> getAllMissions();
     Future<List<LatLng>> getDirections(LatLng start, LatLng end);
   }
   ```
